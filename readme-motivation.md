## Motivation

We wanted to create a single package that would allow communication with the user in a multitude of scenarios.

- pop up a callout that points to a target widget
- pop up a callout that has no target, but can be positioned on the screen
- pop up a callout as a Toast in a variety of positions (using an Alignment properyy)
